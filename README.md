# Etsy-Hacks
Inspired by Fullstack Blog Craigslist Hack.

## Motivation

The motivation for this piece of code was to generate sales leads on Etsy for a small business I was running. I was manually reaching out to all of my competitors customers and users who "liked" our competitors products via Etsy direct messages, letting them know that our products were better and less expensive. There were so many of these people to reach out to that I attempted to automate the process with code. 

I had not yet applied to or been accepted to Fullstack Academy at the time.
